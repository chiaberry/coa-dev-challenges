# DTIF Dev Frontend Homework using React
## An example using React and Socrata SODA API

The app can be seen at https://chiaberry.github.io/coa-dev-challenges/

### To get started:

- Install dependencies: `yarn`
- *note* This app uses a mapbox map which needs an api key to function. Create a `.env` file containing `REACT_APP_MAPBOX_KEY={REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY}`
- Run a local server: `yarn start`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
